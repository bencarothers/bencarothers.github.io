        <title>Productive Python</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;ive-fallen-for-python&quot;&gt;I’ve Fallen For Python.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that I’m a fan of the language.
Python has become my go to too for small weekend projects and my assignments at school – especially
in cases where the scope and complexity of the problem isn’t necessarily a limiting factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it’s fun to use, the code generally ends up being clean and concise,
and it’s really useful for fast, iterative development. Furthermore, the 
huge number of awesome libraries make it possible to do nearly anything your’re 
willing to research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently come across a few tools that, not all necessarily linked to Python,
that have made working in the language both more pleasant and also productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pyenv-and--virtualenv&quot;&gt;Pyenv and  Virtualenv&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with different versions of Python and also different versions of packages
within these versions can be frustrating. If you work in Python for very long
without using virtual environments you’ll undoubtedly end up with some conflicting 
versions and a lengthy output from pip freeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recognized the benefits of virtual environments for awhile, but I could never
commit to using them regularly because it always felt so clunky. Since the projects 
I’m currently involved in are using entirely different versions of Python I finally 
commited to finding a set up that worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyenv is an awesome tool that lets you seemlessly download and switch between 
different versions of Python. Furthermore, by issuing the command, &lt;code&gt;pyenv local /version/&lt;/code&gt;,
you can assign a version of Python to any specific directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By then using the plugin Pyenv-virtualenv you can create virtual environments for 
specific projects using the installed version. For instance, I can create a 
virtual environment for my blog by typing &lt;code&gt;pyenv virtualenv 2.7.9 blog&lt;/code&gt;. Then 
any packages I install will only exist in blog once I type pyenv activate blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encapsulating environments makes testing and coordinating with other team members
much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setuptools-and-travis&quot;&gt;Setuptools and Travis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been using Travis as a contiuous integration service. As you’re developing
something is going to break, and it won’t always be something that you’re expecting.
In fact you usally won’t expect it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Setuptools you can create a setup.py file used to create a distrubtable and
run the tests-suite after locating and downloading all the dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can register your Github repository with Travis, create a small .yaml file
that builds your project and tests it every time you push code. This has been
wonderful because the functionality youre working on isn’t always 
what breaks, so you know where to look without having to manually run your tests.
It often tells me there’s a bug long before I would’ve noticed it during development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coveralls&quot;&gt;Coveralls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I’ve been using Coveralls.io with the package coverage and in cooperation
with Travis to get an idea of where my tests aren’t reaching. Coveralls gives you 
a line by line audit of you’re code showing you which parts are covered in your tests
and where your code is bare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a high percentange doesn’t necessarily mean that every case is 
handled, but the output does give you an idea of areas that could use some
checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nothing the button on my README keeps me accountable, which is useful so that 
I don’t code blindly for hours only to realize I’ve broken some core functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of tools that make development more productive and fun. These are
just a few of the ones that I’ve been using lately.
Check them out here for more info:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Comprehensions in Python</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Python is a really elegantly constructed language that comes packaged with a large library of natural, powerful features. 
I see the language constantly bombarded with criticisms that largely seem to be coming from developers that fail to adopt
a pythonic style of code.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The for loop is one of the first learned and most used snippets of code for any new language. Python is no exception to this
fact
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;numbers = [1,2,3]
numbers_squared = []
for number in numbers:
    number **= 2
    numbers_squared.append(number)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here we have a list of 3 numbers. All we&#39;re looking to do is take each and square it, so that numbers becomes a list of each of its
elements squared. So what&#39;s wrong with this code? Functionally, nothing. We end up with numbers_squared and can carry on with whatever
task we we&#39;re initially trying to tackle. But is this idiomatic, pythonic code? Not quite.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Comprehensions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
List comprehensions are a super easy way to make your code much more readable, cleaner and more efficient. They&#39;re simple and powerful 
and, personally, I think they should be taught right along with for loops.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how could we accomplish the same functionality using comprehensions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;numbers = [1,2,3]
numbers_squared = [number**2 for number in numbers]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four lines are quickly condensed to one and the code is both more beautiful and also more readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly we could do a few more involved operations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;numbers = [1,2,3]
numbers_exponentiated = [[number**2,number**3,number**4] for number in numbers]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Comprehensions also can be nested or used to construct dictionaries. Here we&#39;re creating a dictionary with the numbers as keys and 
squares as values:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;numbers = [1,2,3]
numbers_squared = {number:number**2 for number in numbers}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Python is really well constructed and full of features so don&#39;t knock it too hard before you do a little bit of exploring.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reviving Killed Tmux Sessions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Tmux has become an integral part of my workflow during the past couple of months.
Keeping sessions configured and running keeps my work organized by delegating windows and panes to specific tasks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m not a huge fan of leaving my machine running -- for the reasons of both hardware and productivity preservation.
Every time I shutdown I would lose my sessions, which was pretty annoying because its not often that I&#39;m finished with
a working environment after a single burst of working.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For instance, I like to keep a session for note taking and studying, which I use for an entire semester, and having to
configure windows and panes repeatedly completely destroys the benefits I gain from this system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Luckily, there&#39;s a widely available project called Tmuxinator that allows you to script and configure commonly used
sessions so that they can be renewed quickly in the case of the Tmux server terminating.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Example Configurations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Simple configurations can go a long way. Here&#39;s an example of how I might configure a note taking session if I was invested
in learning both Python and Java.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: notes
root: ~/Documents/Notes/
windows:
  - python:
      root: ~/Documents/Notes/Python
      layout: f98d,230x59,0,0[230x40,0,0,0,230x18,0,41,4]
      panes:
        - vim
        - python
  - java: cd Java; vim
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This snippet creates two windows. One, Python, opens a vertical split of Vim and the Python interpreter for testing bits of code. The other
simply moves to the Java directory and opens Vim to start taking notes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/tmuxWin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Here&#39;s the Python window&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A few window layouts ship with Tmuxinator, but you&#39;re open to create as many as you&#39;d like. The system is highly configurable. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Configurations can be as customized and specific as you&#39;d like -- meaning sessions can be saved and restored with ease.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note, in the case of a sessions accidental death, Tmuxinator will be little help to revive lost data.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Regex For The Masses</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Regular expressions, sequences of characters that define patterns, are widely applicable and strangely controversial.
They can definitely be fickle and buggy. Often because they&#39;re so terse and condensed regular expressions are 
less readable than equivalent counterparts. However, they&#39;re a fundamental aspect of modern software and
for that reason alone simple regular expressions are a crucial part of any developers skill base.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Everyone Searches.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Cory Doctorow once wrote that regular expressions should be included as a core part of our education -- along side
word processors and PowerPoint. Though I want to stress that I love regex, I think that this is a bogus.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Foundationally, computer programs are built around the foundation of manipulating characters -- searching, matching,
and acting according to what was found. For this reason a tool such as regular expressions can be invaluable for 
developers, but the time spent learning and creating regex might outweigh the benefits for your average searcher.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Daily Use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;matching-an-email&quot;&gt;Matching an Email&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There&#39;s a lot of controversy about the correct regex for matching an email address, but there&#39;s no doubt that this could 
be useful for anyone. Searching a document for multiple addresses could be done instantly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As for the make up of the pattern: 
First we look for any number of valid symbols followed by an @ symbol 
then similarly any number of symbols followed by a period 
and finally 2 to 6 characters
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The trade off here between complexity and accuracy wouldn&#39;t be an issue for everyday usage.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;matching-a-phone-number&quot;&gt;Matching a Phone Number:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
^[\d]{3,}$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Much like matching emails finding phone numbers is another dead simple way that regex can be incredibly useful.
This pattern is as simple as finding 3 or more digit 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a great example of a regex that is absolutely inefficient and inexact that would be perfectly ok for an
average user looking for phone numbers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Matching phone numbers can get incredibly complex which is exactly why I don&#39;t think non-developers need a super strong
foundation in regular expressions, but rather the bare minimum
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;matching-white-space&quot;&gt;Matching White Space:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
 [^\S\r\n]{2,}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here is a pattern that eliminates some of the frustrations in cleaning up text documents.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Simply match 2 or more white space characters and then replace them with one. 
Dead simple and really useful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Regular Expressions are everywhere. I think they&#39;re useful for everyone -- probably more so for nerds.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gardening with Pi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
I love gardening for so many reasons -- good food, pretty landscaping, and a reason to get up and take a break from my work.
Though, Living in suburban Southern Florida can make the process a little tougher than I think should be.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Limited to a small patch of brick, I made some adjustments to the conventional home garden that make the process both less stressful
and also a bit more sustainable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The sun is hot - Really, painfully hot - and vegetables don&#39;t grow in concrete. I started planning out a couple of raised
beds that would be far enough off the ground to so that they would be protected from the heat stored in the brick.
I ended up with two four feet by two feet planters -- both with about six cubic feet of soil and sitting on three feet legs.
I was set for my first growing season until I realized just how hot the sun in Florida really is.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Water, please.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Keeping moisture levels optimal was becoming a full time endeavor -- especially because the soil was only 8 inches deep.
I started researching watering practices in arid environments when I happened upon the practice of drip irrigation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Though the technique dates back thousands of years, today droplets of water are applied directly to the base of your plants
through lines of selectively perforated tubing. Coupled with a pressure regulator and filter this system of tubing is one of
the most efficient systems of watering available. It was working really well, but I still needed to water every couple of hours,
which was a problem when I was out of the house.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/img/drip.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;drip irrigation&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Lines of drip tubing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This was when I came upon the Open Sprinkler Pi. This small micro-controller interfaces with a Raspberry Pi allowing it to control 
common sprinkler valves.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The process was pretty simple. First flash an image provided by the Open Sprinkler to the Pi that comes with pre-installed programs
to control your valves in any way imaginable. Then, connect the Pi to the OSPI and run the necessary wires to the valve -- I opted 
for a drip valve simply because my drip system had already been put in place. Finally, whatever program you decide to use is available
through port forwarding and your garden can be watered from anywhere with internet access. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So far the system is working beautifully. I opted to write a program that scrapes a Twitter account and parses watering commands because
, frankly, the applications provided had more features than I needed.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I do still like to water manually so I can see how things are growing, but it&#39;s nice to be able to be away from home without having to
worry about thirsty plants. Plus, the system is highly extensible so it leaves endless opportunity to explore in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
