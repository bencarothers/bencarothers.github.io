Regular expressions, sequences of characters that define patterns, are widely applicable and strangely controversial.
They can definitely be fickle and buggy. Often because they're so terse and condensed regular expressions are 
less readable than equivalent counterparts. However, they're a fundamental aspect of modern software and
for that reason alone simple regular expressions are a crucial part of any developers skill base.

Cory Doctorow once wrote that regular expressions should be included as a core part of our education -- along side
word processors and PowerPoint. Though I want to stress that I love regex, I think that this is a bogus.
</p>

<p>
Foundationally, computer programs are built around the foundation of manipulating characters -- searching, matching,
and acting according to what was found. For this reason a tool such as regular expressions can be invaluable for 
developers, but the time spent learning and creating regex might outweigh the benefits for your average searcher.

<h2 class="section-heading">Daily Use</h2>

<p>
####Matching an Email
</p>

<p>
^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$
</p>
<p>
There's a lot of controversy about the correct regex for matching an email address, but there's no doubt that this could 
be useful for anyone. Searching a document for multiple addresses could be done instantly.
</p>
<p>
As for the make up of the pattern: 
First we look for any number of valid symbols followed by an @ symbol 
then similarly any number of symbols followed by a period 
and finally 2 to 6 characters
</p>
<p>
The trade off here between complexity and accuracy wouldn't be an issue for everyday usage.
</p>

<p>
####Matching a Phone Number:
</p>
<p>
^[\d]{3,}$
</p>
<p>
Much like matching emails finding phone numbers is another dead simple way that regex can be incredibly useful.
This pattern is as simple as finding 3 or more digit 
</p>
<p>
This is a great example of a regex that is absolutely inefficient and inexact that would be perfectly ok for an
average user looking for phone numbers.
</p>
<p>
Matching phone numbers can get incredibly complex which is exactly why I don't think non-developers need a super strong
foundation in regular expressions, but rather the bare minimum
</p>
<p>
####Matching White Space:
</p>

<p>
####Matching White Space:
</p>
<p>
[^\S\r\n]{2,}
</p>
<p>
Here is a pattern that eliminates some of the frustrations in cleaning up text documents.
</p>
<p>
Simply match 2 or more white space characters and then replace them with one. 
Dead simple and really useful.
</p>

<p>
Regular Expressions are everywhere. I think they're useful for everyone -- probably more so for nerds.
