        <title>Gardening with Pi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
I love gardening for so many reasons -- good food, pretty landscaping, and a reason to get up and take a break from my work.
Though, Living in suburban Southern Florida can make the process a little tougher than I think should be.

Limited to a small patch of brick, I made some adjustments to the conventional home garden that make the process both less stressful
and also a bit more sustainable.

The sun is hot - Really, painfully hot - and vegetables don&#39;t grow in concrete. I started planning out a couple of raised
beds that would be far enough off the ground to so that they would be protected from the heat stored in the brick.
I ended up with two four feet by two feet planters -- both with about six cubic feet of soil and sitting on three feet legs.
I was set for my first growing season until I realized just how hot the sun in Florida really is.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Water, please.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Keeping moisture levels optimal was becoming a full time endeavor -- especially because the soil was only 8 inches deep.
I started researching watering practices in arid environments when I happened upon the practice of drip irrigation.

Though the technique dates back thousands of years, today droplets of water are applied directly to the base of your plants
through lines of selectively perforated tubing. Coupled with a pressure regulator and filter this system of tubing is one of
the most efficient systems of watering available. It was working really well, but I still needed to water every couple of hours,
which was a problem when I was out of the house.

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Lines of drip tubing&lt;/span&gt;

This was when I came upon the Open Sprinkler Pi. This small micro-controller interfaces with a Raspberry Pi allowing it to control 
common sprinkler valves.

The process was pretty simple. First flash an image provided by the Open Sprinkler to the Pi that comes with pre-installed programs
to control your valves in any way imaginable. Then, connect the Pi to the OSPI and run the necessary wires to the valve -- I opted 
for a drip valve simply because my drip system had already been put in place. Finally, whatever program you decide to use is available
through port forwarding and your garden can be watered from anywhere with internet access. 

So far the system is working beautifully. I opted to write a program that scrapes a Twitter account and parses watering commands because
, frankly, the applications provided had more features than I needed.  

I do still like to water manually so I can see how things are growing, but it&#39;s nice to be able to be away from home without having to
worry about thirsty plants. Plus, the system is highly extensible so it leaves endless opportunity to explore in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
